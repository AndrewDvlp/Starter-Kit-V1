# My first go into a DevStarter Kit 
// Based on the work of Travis Neilson and his YouTube channel DevTips (https://github.com/travisneilson && https://github.com/DevTips/DevTips-Starter-Kit)

This is a very basic starter kit for front-end development projects. 
It intends to serve as a learning playground to include development tools and get familiarized with them.
Also it will be used to get comfortable structuring sharable and maintainable code bases.

- Jade
- Sass
- Gulp (check package.json file for a complete list of plugins and dependencies)
- Jquery

# How to use
